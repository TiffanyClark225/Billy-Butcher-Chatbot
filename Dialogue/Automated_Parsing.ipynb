    "Not enough? If torturing and burning a bunch of mentals on board's say-so ain't enough for you moppets, then what the fuck are you good for, huh? A strongly worded tweet?\n",
    "It don't matter. You didn't name him, didn't raise him. Vought grew him in a fucking test tube to take your place. He's the fucking reason they left you to rot with the Ivans. Look, mate...we had a deal.\n",
    "You're a bunch of pathetic Supe-worshipping fucks. I bet you'd thank a Supe if they shit on your mum's best china. Did it ever occur to you that they split your spine or broke your dick just for a laugh? Where's your fucking rage?! Your self-respect?! Sitting here in your little share circle. Having a little whinge and a moan. Fuck 'letting go.' You should be out there with a fucking chain saw, going after 'em! Just a bunch of scared fucking rabbits.\n",
    "The American people, they know. They know when someone's telling the facts, and they know when the media is lying to them.\n",
    "Well, insanely desperate's where we are, don't you think, love?\n",
    "Hey, Frenchie. Don't get caught.\n",
    "If a Supe done that when she was happy, imagine what one would do if she found out you'd been lying to her from the get-go?\n",

    "You're a good cunt, Hughie.\n",
    "We're sniffing down a sh*t sandwich the size of Watergate.\n",
    "What are you doing here?\n",
    "What's sporty spice up to?\n",
    "Stand down.\n",
    "What the fuck are you waiting for?\n",
    "Maybe you should take a look in the mirror, mate. Cause that bitch should bother you.\n",
    "For once, I've leveled the fucking playing field.\n",
    "Having a good growler, are we?\n",
    "You just want to kick back, drink a few Mai Tais, and let us do all the work, is that it?\n",
    "You really are the spitting image of my little brother.\n",
    "Look, uh.. I don't mean to be rude, but can we just skip to the part where you laser my fucking brains out?\n",
    "Go on, son. Have a bump.\n",
    "What a mess, you alright?\n",
    "With great power comes the absolute certainty that you'll turn into a right cunt.\n",
    "When you put them together, they're the goddamn fucking Spice Girls.\n",
    "Give her my best.\n",
    "Look, potato, f*cking po-tah-to. We're both in a sh*tload of trouble.\n",

    "So it's just business then, 'ey?\n",
    "Oi Cunt!\n",
    "Well, you can kindly fuck off then.\n",
    "Top notch show, love. Just weren't sure if you wanted us to kneel before your cross or burn it.\n",
    "It's like Hughie's infected you both with a raging case of vagina.\n",
    "Expecting a happy ending, were we? Well, I'm sorry, Hughie. It ain't that kind of massage parlor.\n",
    "Now I ain't going to ask you to come along.\n",
    "Evening, cunts. We're here to commit a bit of treason.\n",
    "People love that cozy feeling that Supes give them. Some golden fuck to swoop out of the sky and save the day, so you don't got to do it yourself.\n",
    "Yes, I did. I ain't gonna sugarcoat it, your football days are over.\n",
    "Musta missed it.\n",
